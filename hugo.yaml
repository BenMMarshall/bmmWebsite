      I am currently employed as a Post-doctoral Research Assistant at the University of Glasgow UK, where I am responsible for the analysis of deer movement and rodent occurrence data. I am working with a team developing landscape-wide maps describing deer and rodent habitat connectivity. These connectivity maps feed into a wider project examining how tick hosts and landscape characteristics influence tick densities and the prevalence of Lyme disease.

      Outside of my primary employment at Glasgow, I continue to participate in several collaborations involving the exploration and sharing of a large quantity of US-derived wildlife trade data, the testing utility of modern movement ecology analyses for snake movement data, and the examination of Jungle Crow behaviour and morphology.
