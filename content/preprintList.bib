	abstract = {Animal movement datasets are growing in number and depth, and researchers require a growing number of analytical approaches to adequately answer questions using movement datasets. As the complexity of questions and analyses increase, deciding on the best approach both in terms of study design and analysis can become more difficult. A potential solution is to simulate an array of synthetic datasets under varying study designs and simulation parametrisations to gain insight into the impact of analysis choice(s) in different contexts. The abmAnimalMovement R package provides the means of simulating animal movement for this purpose. The abmAnimalMovement simulations use a discrete time agent-based model and does not require previous movement data as an input. The simulations include a number of key internal and external movement influences, as well as parameters for navigation and mobility capacity of the animal. Internal influences include three predefined behavioural states (e.g., rest, explore, forage) and any number of activity cycles (e.g., diel, seasonal). External influences are implemented via matrices describing landscape characteristics (e.g., shelter quality, foraging resources, movement ease), and predefined points describing shelter sites and points the animal aims to avoid. Navigation capacity is defined by the range the animal can dynamically choose a foraging location to which it is subsequently attracted. Mobility capacity is implemented by user defined distributions, from which step length and turn angles are draw at each time step, governing the possible subsequent locations of the animal. Critically, the navigation capacity (the choice of destination) operates on a different time scale to the mobility capacity, allowing the internal state of the animal to differ from the observed movements. When combined with other emergent properties, such as site fidelity generated via repeated shelter site use, the simulations offer opportunities to test whether movement analyses can accurately recover hidden mechanisms, states, and drivers.},

          Researchers are intrinsically part of the research process. While we may strive for objectivity, there are always judgement calls required during research. When you ask ten researchers to answer the same question with the same dataset, you will likely receive ten different answers. This variation in answers has been linked to several disciplines’ replication crises. Here, we explore whether answers from movement ecology, specifically habitat selection, vary as a result of differing analytical choices. We conducted a multiverse analysis on around 400 synthetic animal movement datasets, exploring a multitude of analysis pathways to determine habitat selection, resulting in approximately half a million unique estimates of selection. By using simulated virtual animals with a known preference, we were able to show which decisions during analysis could lead to more variable estimates of habitat selection. The multiverse revealed that data quantity (i.e., tracking frequency and duration) was more important to obtaining consistent answers than any analysis choice. Overall, the pattern of estimates shows the majority of analysis pathways provide similar final results, particularly for modern analysis methods. The pattern reflects findings from other disciplines, indicating that while movement ecology is not immune to issues of non-replicability stemming from researcher choice, it is also not at any greater risk than other disciplines.},

            Wetlands are particularly vulnerable to degradation in urban environments, partially due to the introduction of non-native plants. Invasive weeds in wetlands can replace native plants leading to alterations in habitat composition and vegetation, in turn, animal movements and ultimately population dynamics might be affected. Here we investigate how home range size and movements of western tiger snakes (
            Notechis scutatus occidentalis
            ) differ in wetlands dominated by invasive kikuyu grass (
            Cenchrus clandestinus
            ) compared to wetlands dominated by native vegetation to understand if and how the movement ecology of this top-order predator is altered by vegetation homogenization. To do so, we used Autocorrelated Kernel Density Estimators (AKDE) to estimate home range size, dynamic Brownian Bridge Movement Models to document movement trajectory confidence areas, and compared movement distances using a Bayesian regression model. Home range sizes by tiger snakes were 14.59 ± 9.35 ha smaller in areas dominated by invasive versus native vegetation. Moreover, within-day movement distances tended to be smaller in areas dominated by invasive versus native vegetation (mean ± SD: 9 ± 3 m versus 18 ± 6 m), but there was considerable overlap between the 95\% credible intervals between these two groups. Smaller home ranges by tiger snakes in areas dominated by invasive kikuyu grass were likely driven by thermoregulation, with snakes moving vertically between basking locations on top of kikuyu and shelter sites at the base, rather than travelling horizontally along the ground to open basking areas in sites dominated by native vegetation. Additionally, fragmentation of sites dominated by invasive vegetation might have contributed to the comparatively smaller home ranges of snakes there. These findings add to our understanding how changes in habitat composition driven by invasive vegetation can affect animal space use and emphasise the need for further studies to understand how these changes affect population dynamics.},
